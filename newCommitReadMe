Hey Y'all, Matt here! In this commit I finished the commit fucntion and fixed the add fucntion so now it doesn't add to the minigit directory.
Now the commit fucntion does that. Also, FYI, the most currect commit is the head of the DLL node and the previous version is linked to head->next. 

Something like: Head-->prev commit--> prev commit to new head(curr) --> head (old head) --> prev commit --> commit.

If you have any question tag me in discord!
